Installation steps
------------------

1. Copy resque directory to your app's cookbooks/ folder (create the cookbooks folder if you don't have one)
2. Customize the template on line 5 and 6 to meet your needs. Alternately, if you want all workers to run
   all queues, you may switch the recipe to use the resque_all_queues.pill.erb template instead.
3. Customize the template's mem_usage setting to be appropriate for your application.
4. Customize the recipe's num_workers to meet your needs.
5. Add the after restart hook from after_restart.rb to your deploy/after_restart.rb file (create one if you
   don't have one). You can then delete this file from your local cookbook.
6. Commit and push your changes.
7. Upload your recipe to your app by running "ey recipes upload -e environment_name"
8. Run "ey recipes apply" to apply your custom recipes and then "ey deploy" to deploy. Alternately, you can do
   a full deploy from the EY Cloud dashboard.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If your resque setup does not load the environment already, you may wish to add "environment" before
"resque:work" in the start_command in the template. Alternately, add this rake task to your application (e.g.
in lib/tasks/resque.rake):

    task 'resque:setup' => :environment
